# Specialty-Coffee-Prediction MVP



First we start with looking at our data to see what we are working with. There are three datasets available: arabica_data_cleaned, robusta_data_cleaned and merged_data_cleaned. 
I will use the merged dataset as it is the combined dataset of the other two.

# Our steps:

1-	Exploratory data analysis

2-	Clean the data. 

3-	Train/test split.

4-	Model building.


# What are we working with?

For the model I will use the following 9 variables. The original dataset has 44 variables.


# Dependent variable:

•	Total cup points: Number of points the end product coffee has stored by the CQI jury (1-100 points; 100 is the highest score)


# Independent variables:

•	Country of origin: Where the coffee comes from

•	Harvest year: Which year it was harvested

•	Variety: Which variety of coffee it is

•	Processing method: Which method was used to process it before roasting

•	Color: Which color the coffee in the cup has

•	Category one defects: How many cat. 1 defects the coffee has

•	Category two defects: How many cat. 2 defects the coffee has

•	Mean altitude (m): At which mean altitude this coffee is cultured


# •	Goal:


Model the relationship between predictors in an outcome of interest and using the models to predict a future outcome.
