# Specialty-Coffee-Prediction
# How do you know the best quality specialty coffee?
Coffee is a beverage highly appreciated in all around the world due to its natural 
product with varied aromas and tastes. The cupping score is a score for a coffee 
quality graded with an expert called Q grader. The cupping score will decide if a 
coffee may be called as specialized.
# The goal:
We are going to build a model will be used to predict the total cup point value, where 
this value determines whether a coffee product can be considered specialty coffee.
# Dataset
The data set, originally uploaded from Coffee Quality Database, was re-posted to Kaggle
The datasets have reviews from specialized reviewers for both coffees: Arabica and 
Robusta. The below information is provided in each dataset.
The data obtained is still in the form of raw data containing attributes such as 
company, mill, farm name, and the others.
The features used as input are the country of origin, , processing method, moisture, 
color, and the plantation's altitude. These attributes were chosen according to the 
characteristics, varieties, and processing methods because these attributes were 
considered to describe the quality of the coffee beans.

# Sample of data is shown in the following table:
